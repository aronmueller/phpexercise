PHP Exercise with Unit Testing

Real Fizz Buzz Assessment

Please note the following files:

/src/index.php is what you should launch in your browser to see my application. This interface lets you input the maximum range for the sequence and see the result for all three steps. Of course, you need to have Xampp or Wamp running on your computer first.

/src/FizzBuzz.php contains the primary functions that process the data.

/src/FuzzBuzzClass.php contains the classes necessary to meet the different criteria between the steps.

/tests/FizzBuzzTest.php contains a couple tests I wrote that work with the PHP classes. I am new to UnitTesting, but I managed to pick it up quickly enough to get the tests to run correctly. If you already have PHPUnit installed, you should be able to run them.
